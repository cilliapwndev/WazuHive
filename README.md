# WazuHive
WazuHive is an interactive, modular script designed to simplify and strengthen the deployment of Wazuh agents — across Linux, Windows, and macOS. It’s more than an installer: it’s a threat-aware, defender-focused utility that adds meaningful detection and hardening features to any Wazuh endpoint setup.
